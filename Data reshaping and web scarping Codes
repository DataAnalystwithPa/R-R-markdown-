convert data format from wide to long/ long to wide:
gather(key=  , value=   ) : change wide fromat to long format 
spread(key=  , value=   ) : change the long format to wide format
Key= 
	They key is usually a categorical variables showing time/location/treatment index 
	When gathering, the key is usually not in the data frame, need to name it 
Value= 
	For spread(): the variable that stores the values being spread, only one value, e.g. value=sbp 
	For gather(): the variable to hold the gathered values is not in the data frame, need to name it, and need the variables that currently have the values being gathered 
	spread(): no need of new variables 
	gather(): both key and the first values are new variables
