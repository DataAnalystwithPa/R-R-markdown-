#1.	Use the piggy data, is that data a long format or a wide format? Change the format

```{r}
library(rvest)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(Lahman)
```

```{r}
Piggy %>%
  gather(key = week, value = weights, week0,week4, week8, week12, week16)

#2.	Use the Diabete data, change the format with a variable SBP showing the systolic blood pressure at different times.
Diabete %>%
  spread(key= Time, value = SBP)
```
#3.	Use the Tree data, find the mean for each variables of group, branch density, branch thickness, and tree heights. Use one of the apply functions.

```{r}
Tree_data %>%
  apply(data= Tree_data, MARGIN = 2, FUN = mean, na.rm=TRUE)
```
#4.	Use the Teams data, choose the variables: teamID, Rank, G, W, L, R, and RA. Use apply (), sapply(), and lapply() to find the mean of each column
```{r}
Team1<-Teams %>%
  select(teamID, Rank, G, W, L,R, RA)

lapply(Team1, MARGIN = 2, FUN = mean, na.rm=TRUE)
sapply(Team1, MARGIN = 2, FUN = mean, na.rm=TRUE)
apply(Team1, MARGIN = 2, FUN = mean, na.rm=TRUE)
```
#5.	This is the Wikipedia website about the 2022 Winter Olympics medal winners :
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2022_Winter_Olympics_medal_winners
Table 13 shows the winning athletes in figure skating. Scrape that table.

```{r}
library(rvest)
table1<- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_2022_Winter_Olympics_medal_winners")
table1 %>%
  html_nodes("table")%>%
  html_table(fill=TRUE)%>%
  .[[13]]

#1.the data Sea Food recorded the bacterial growth on oysters and mussels. The bacterial counts are measured in log scale at three different times. 
a)	Is the data given in a long format or a wide format? Use a comment to write your answer.
b)	Convert the data to have one variable showing the bacterial counts and one variable showing the different time points.

```{r}
#Data is in wide format; when output is more than 1 than it wide format 
#Q1. Convert data wide to long 
Seafood_data %>%
  gather(key = Seafood, value = new, time0, time1, time2)
```
#2.	Use the Teams data in Lahman package. The team IDs corresponding to Brooklyn baseball teams are listed as: “BR1”,”BR2”,”BR3”,”BR4”,”BR”,”BRP”,”BRF”

a)	Keep the variables teamID, HR (home runs) and HRA (homeruns allowed). 
b)	Keep only Brooklyn baseball teams (“BR1”,”BR2”,”BR3”,”BR4”,”BR”,”BRP”,”BRF”).
c)	Choose one apply function to find the average home runs (HR) and average homeruns allowed (HRA).


```{r}
#Q2
Teams %>%
   filter(teamID %in% c("BR1", "BR2", "BR3", "BR4", "BR","BRF", "BRP"))%>%
 select(teamID, HR, HRA)%>%
lapply( MARGIN = 2, FUN = mean, na.rm=TRUE)
```
#3.	This website https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Summer_Olympics recorded the medal counts for the 2016 Summer Olympics. Scrape the table 11 to find the medal counts.

```{r}
#Q3
library(rvest)
table13<- read_html("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016_Summer_Olympics")
table13 %>%
  html_nodes("table")%>%
  html_table(fill=TRUE)%>%
  .[[11]]
