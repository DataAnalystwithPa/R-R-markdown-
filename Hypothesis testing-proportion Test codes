Steps of doing hypothesis testing 
Step1: null and alternative 
	H0: p=
	Ha: p>.. or p<, or p…
Step2: choose a test 
Step3: find the test statistic and p=value 
Step4: make a decision 

formulate null and alterative hypotheses:
null hypotheses: statement is neutral and shows “no difference”, no relationship 
alternative hypothesis: if > or <, it is one tailed; if it is twosided


Test statistic= 
-	For testing one-sample proportion 
o	Sample proportion; p: population proportion in; n:sample size 
-	For comparing two proportions 
If p-value <0.05 then we reject H0 
If p-value >0.05 then we fail to reject H0
Function: prop.test(x=….,n=…,p=….,alternative=”…”)
	x: number of outcomes
	n: sample size 
	p: the population proportion value claimed in
	alternative: the tails of 
	“two.side”    -- when comparing two variables if one is higher than the other 
	“greater”
	“less”
