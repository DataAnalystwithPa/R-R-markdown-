These are my Task that I have to do for my homework on Learning R function of inputs and outpust:  

1. What does the following function return? Why? (Write comments in your RMarkdown file with a
couple of sentences to explain why you obtain such an output).
F1<-function(x=2, y=0) {
x+y
}
F1(3,4)

#[1] 7  it shows this because the input specifically stated that x and y equals 3,4 so when it goes into the function it adds up both of those numbers instead on 2 and 0. 

2. What does the following function return? Why? (Write comments in your RMarkdown file to
explain why your output is like that)
l<-function (x){
result<-x+1
return(result)
}
m<-function(){
l<-function(x) {
result<-x*2
return(result)
}
l(10)
}
m()

#[1] 20 because the coding stated that to put in 10 as the variable of I and shows/print out  the function of m only

3. Create a function in R to calculate the T statistic for the one-sample T-test
T = x−μ
s
√ n
Where x is the sample mean, μ is the population mean, s is the sample standard deviation and n
is the sample size. Suppose the input arguments are x, μ, s and n
Call your function with the inputs: x=2.1, μ=1, s=0.5, n=50
CODE:
T_stat<-function(x,u,s,n){
  T<-(x-u)/(s/sqrt(n))
  return(T)
}
T_stat(2.1,1,0.5,50)

4. Your collaborator tells you that you can use the length of the hindfoot to calculate brain volume.
Apparently the hindfoot of these creatures is equal to the diameter of their skulls. Write a
function that will calculate the volume of the animals’ skulls and apply it to this dataset. The
formula of volume of a sphere is 4∗π∗r3
3 , where r is the radius of the skull. Include one input:
d being the diameter of the skull. Call the function with the inputs: d=5, where d is the
diameter (hindfoot) of a skull.
CODE:
voulme<-function (d){
    r<-d/2
    result<-(4*pi*(r^3))/3
    return(result)
  }
voulme(5)

5. Create a function to find the center of mass for two masses, with four parameters (input or
arguments) being m1, m2, x1 and x2, where m1 and m2 are the mass of the two and x1 and x2
are the locations of the two masses. The following figure showed the calculation of the center of
two masses.
Call the function with the inputs: m1=2 , m2=5 , x1=3 ,∧x2=10
CODE: 
center<-function(m1,m2,x1,x2){
  C<-((m1*x1)+(m2*x2))/(m1+m2)
  return(C)
}
center(2,5,3,10)
