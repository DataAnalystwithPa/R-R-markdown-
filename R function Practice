#1.	Download the student data and read it into R; Find the mean grade. What is the mean grade?
mean(student_data$Grade) 
```

```{r}
#2.	Write a function called revword() to reverse any word using the functions 
strsplit(a, “”)[[1]]
  this function is to split the word into letters, where a is a word
rev()
   this function is to reverse the letters
paste(b, collapse=“”)
   this function is to paste all the letters into a word

Run the function with the input of “sum”

#codes
revword<- function(a){
  b<-strsplit(a, "")[[1]]
  c<- rev(b)
  d<-paste(c, collapse = "")
  return (c)
}
revword("sum")
  
```

```{r}
#1.      
Write a function called expratio(), to calculate
the following x/e^(1+x)
Using the function exp() to calculate
exponentials. Run the function to find 3/e^(1+3)

expratio<-function(x){
  result<-exp(x/(1+x))
  return(result)
}
expratio(3)
```
